**Version 0.0.17**

    * [[Thanks]]

    * [[Fixed Issues]]
        * PDF embed doesn't work if the page name has blanks

        * Blank page for page graph
        * Disable multiple instances at the moment

        * When selecting some text, the shortcuts for bold, italics and highlight should jump to a correct position
        * Multiple parser issues

    * [[Features]]
        * Add an option `:scheduled/future-days` for the `Scheduled and Deadline` section, the default value is `0` , which means it only display tasks for `Today` .

            * We'll support more kinds of files soon, e.g. pdf, epub, mp3, etc.

        * 2. Added `page` query.
For example: (page "Page Alias"):
{{query((page "Page Alias"))}}

    * [[Enhancement]]
        * 1. **Much stable Undo && Redo**
`Notice` : It could be slow with page that has many blocks.
There's a bug with block timestamps enabled, so we disabled it temporally.
        * 2. `Ctrl+s` to save and push to GitHub
        * 3. Add `git-auto-push` to settings page, you can disable the auto push and type `Ctrl+s` to push yourself :)
        * 4. Add page title when searching blocks
        * 5. Add an option to disable the journals and set a default home page

    * [[Fixed Issues]]
        * 1. Remove duplicate blocks in references
        * 2. Properties not working well when enter at the start
        * 3. Can't enter to create a new block at the end of code
        * 4. Fixed `Scheduled` not working sometime
        * 5. Unique constraint issue when loading files
        * 6. Fix `all-page-tags` query
        * 7. Page refs in properties should be counted too
        * 8. Codemirror not working well with block timestamps
        * 9. Do not push local repo when switching repos
        * 10. Many other bugs on GitHub.
