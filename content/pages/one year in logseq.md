* **What's logseq?**
    * At present, it's a note-taking app
        * It's also a community for knowledge sharing and collaboration, yes, our discord group and forum!

    * In the future, we hope Logseq can be more helpful for everyone around the world.

* **Why the name?**
later:: 1616236181947
I know `log` is for daily notes, what `seq` means?
    * It's a sequence of our notes, ideas and thoughts. To me it's all the things I want to remember in my life.

* **Why building logseq?**
    * I started a side project called `putchar.org` back in 2018, which is Medium for programmers, a place to publish and discuss tech articles.
        * Unfortunately, it's deprecated after more than 1 year working on it because for me It's hard to build a community and I have some contracts at that time so that I can't focus on it.
        * But I still want to make it better for general knowledge publishing and collaboration.
        * Also, many code, especially the parser for logseq are from some of my previous side projects, so failures are not that bad :)

    * I was using both Org-mode and TiddlyWiki for my notes, I want to read my notes and capture some links on mobile, also, I want a better outliner UI on web  compared to text editors like Emacs and Vim.
    * So, when my last contract ended at the end of 2020, I knew it's the time to build something! üòé

* **What's the difference between logseq and other tools?**
    * * *The user is the king of the data. * * [[local-first]]
Simply put, I don't trust putting my notes and my life on any cloud services without End-to-End encryption support.
    * **Logseq doesn't lock the data.**
        * Even though logseq is an outliner tool, it works directly with plain-text like Markdown and Org mode. We believe in plain-text for data longevity, we believe in standard syntaxes and open protocols for better collaboration with the existing ecosystem.
        * Shameless plug, logseq might be the **_first_** app that have two-way sync between plain-text and outliner, yay!

    * **Everyone can build their own workflows**
Slip box? GTD? Hierarchical tags? With [[Queries]] , [[Advanced Queries]] and coming [[Plugins]] , nothing is impossible!
    * **Open Source**
As developers, we believe the ultimate fun is to fork the code and do nasty tweaks!
    * **Being different instead of a clone**
        * Bring org mode's task management and many other features to Markdown
        * The first(might be) note-taking app with Git sync on Web (Thanks to [[Isomorphic-git]] )
        * The first(might be) note-taking app can work with your local files on Web
        * ` /Page Embed`
        * `/Draw` integration with [[Excalidraw]]
        * `Now Later workflow`
        * Custom queries on journals page
        * Publishing the whole web app to your own website

* **The future**
    * More stable and more performant
    * Better undo/redo #undotree
    * End-to-End encryption storage
    * Mobile apps
    * Real-time collaboration
    * Exploring more ways to help for thoughts
    * Who knows?

* **Thank you everyone for your time, have a great weekend!** üôè
